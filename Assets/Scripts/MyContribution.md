# My Contribution
As a programmer, I created script for core framework which established the game loop and logic, also enabling UI control. I also implemented specific game mechanics such as needle attachment and eyeball animation.

The game jam required us not to use old source from previous projects. Therefore I had to adjust my workflow and code design accordingly with situation to succesfully complete the working build in time. Following lists are overviews about the approach I took to accomplish my task.

* Handling Game Loop and Logic:
  * [GameManager](#gamemanager)
  * [ScoreManager](#scoremanager)
  * [UI Control](#ui-control)
* Gameplay Mechanics:
  * [Eyeball Movement](#eyeball-movement)
  * [Needle](#needle)
  * [Sound Effect](#sound-effect)
