# Overview
This game was created during my first ever game jam by three people in 24 hours.

# Code Overview
As a programmer, I created script for core framework which established the game loop and game logic, enabled UI control, and implemented specific game mechanics such as needle attachment and eyeball animation. The game jam required us not to use old source from previous projects. Therefore I had to adjust my workflow and code design accordingly with situation to succesfully complete the working build in time. Following lists are overviews about the approach I took to accomplish my task.

* Handling Game Loop and Logic:
  * [GameManager](#gamemanager)
  * [ScoreManager](#scoremanager)
  * [UI Control](#ui-control)
* Gameplay Mechanics:
  * [Eyeball Movement](eyeball-movement)
  * [Needle](needle)
  * [SFX Player(sfx-player)
